Hello! My name is Ariel Rokem, and I am a data-scientist at the University of
Washington eScience Institute. In a previous talk, you heard about our DSSG
program. In my talk, I will discuss a few of the challenges that we face in
doing data science in general, and DSSG more specifically within a university
environment. I will also try to offer a couple of promising directions, from our
own experience, and hope to have further discussions about this later in the
day.

### Doing Data Science

???

What does it mean to do data science in the university?

In more and more research, future advances depend on our ability to record,
process, analyze, and understand large, heterogeneous, noisy data. On the one
hand, these are exciting times, in which we look forward to a near future in
which data will be able to address many important societal challenges.


On the other hand, the data-intensive future poses some tremendous challenges.

--

Extracting actionable insights from large heterogeneous noisy data

???

In this presentation, I will tell you aout the eScience Institute, and I will tell you how we are working at the eScience Institute to future-proof data-intensive discovery, by developing the role of data science at the University, and beyond.

### I am trained as a neuroscientist

Neuroscience is data-intensive!

???
Neuroimaging data, here showing a human brain scanned with an MRI machine at millimeter resolution, can provide detailed information about the structure and function of an individual human brain.

These data provide some amazing opportunities

#### Data Science in academia: the data deluge

--
Across many different fields

???

This data deluge is not unique to neuroscience
--

Astronomy

???
Other fields, like astronomy...
--

Genetics

???
...and genetics, have been dealing with large data sets for many years.

What is unique at this time is that this data deluge is now affecting many more fields, some of whom have never been
--

...

--

#### Including many fields in the social sciences

???
One example are fields in the social sciences. Where some questions could once be answered by collecting responses in a survey, many researchers can now turn to large data-sets at the scale of entire societies.

### Challenges for Data Science in academia

- Data science methodology: computer science, statistics, applied math, etc.

--

- Domain research questions: neuroscience, astrophysics, sociology, etc.

???
A major part of the work that we do is to develop tools and software that will be useful to researchers in a variety of fields. This means that we connect work in data science methodology, such as computer science, statistics, and others, with work in specific domains.

---

#### Open-source science: the scientific Python eco-system

<image src="images/python-ecosystem1.png" height=500px>

???

We all rely on the Python language itself
---

#### Open-source science: the scientific Python eco-system

<image src="images/python-ecosystem2.png" height=500px>

???

Over the years, people have developed excellent tools in Python to support basic computational tasks that are common across many fields. For example, a library called numpy supports numerical operations on multi-dimensional arrays of data, such as those in image data.

Another library called scipy supports a wide range of computations, signal processing, statistics, optimization, and so forth.

#### Open-source science: the scientific Python eco-system

<image src="images/python-ecosystem3.png" height=500px>

???
On top of these basic tools, others have built tools that support a variety of domain agnostic operations: machine learning, plotting, symbolic math, etc.

#### Open-source science: the scientific Python eco-system

<image src="images/python-ecosystem4.png" height=500px>

???
Finally, researchers in various domains

Part of what makes this ecosystem so powerful is the fact that information flows in both directions: researchers at the edges, in various domains rely on the central projects, such as numpy and scipy, but they also contribute back to the development of these projects, allowing everyone to enjoy the network effect of an open and collaborative development community.

### The challenge of novelty squared

<a href="https://medium.com/@profjsb/novelty-squared-dd88857f662#.j9jtwaxe9">Josh Bloom</a>: "the challenge of finding work that may be simultaneously novel both to the domain scientist and to the core computation, statistical, and algorithmic scientist. "

???
This kind of research poses a particular kind of challenge, because both sides of the collaboration have to be interested in it. This is what Josh Bloom, an astrophysicst from our collaborating institute at Berkeley has called "The challenge of novelty squared"

Living in the future has its downsides! This work will not produce a neuroscience paper in the immediate future. Instead, it might produce the systems that all neuroscientists will use in 5 years!

So - while novelty squared is hard, it is also potentially transformative!

### Expanding the network: DSSG

Addresses two additional challenges:

???

Another form of our incubator projects is our Data Science for Social Good Program (or DSSG). This program addresses two major challenges.
--

How do we train data-scientists with a strong interest in social sciences?

???
The first is the education of data-scientists, especially in the social sciences, and fields that pertain to social good
--

How do we enable data-driven approaches in institutions devoted to social good?

???
The other is our ability to provide solutions to "real-world" problems outside the university.
--
#### Additional challenges:

--
- How do we sustain projects over the long run?

--
- How do we maintain continuity?

### Image Processing Across Domains

Many research domains use image data!

<video preload="auto" width="60%" height="auto" data-setup="{}" autoplay loop ><source src="./videos/moth.mov"/> </video>

???
For example, we have noticed that researchers at the institute from several different fields all use image data and image processing algorithms in their research. For example, researchers in the biology department use high-speed cameras to record the flight of moths, and analyze these data to better understand how their wings work.

### Image Processing Across Domains

Many research domains use image data!

???
Researchers in astronomy use humongous image data to model the structure of distant galaxies.

### Image Processing Across Domains

Computer Science: Magda Balazinska, Alvin Cheung, Parmita Mehta, Sven Dorkenwald, Dongfang Zhang

Astronomy: Andy Connoly, Jake Vanderplas

Biology: Dave Williams

???

Magda Balazinska and others on the Computer Science and Engineering department have developed systems for cloud computing data analysis, such as the Myria system. Our current work together builds upon this expertiese to build together the next generation of scientific image processing tools, that will serve researchers across all of these domains, and more.

### The challenge of reproducibility

Reproducibility is a bed-rock of the scientific method.

--

As data and computations become more elaborate, it's not enough to describe you did.

--

#### Show your work!

--

This becomes even harder when the data are sensitive, contain PII...

--

... which is often the case for DSSG projects!


???
As I mentioned before, one of the challenges for DS is that as the data and computations become more elaborate, a simple verbal description of the procedures will not suffice.

Instead, one way to restore the trust in the reproducibility of the work is to conduct our research in a manner that is transparent and open.
